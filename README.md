# admin-dashboard

I'm creating a dashboard that can be used by an admin to track their work. The dashboard will have a few sections that can help display information in a clear manner.
The applications will have a navigation portion, a search bar, display the admin with their information, a list of their projects they are managing, and a list of the team members they are in charge of.
